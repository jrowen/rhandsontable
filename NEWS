rhandsontable 0.3
-------------------------

* Updated to handsontable 0.20.1. (see https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/releases).  Row and column grouping no longer supported in open source version.

* Fixed a bug that didn't return the changed column and row index when the table is sorted (#56)

* Fixed a bug that didn't allow column formatting when the column headers were NULL (#57)

rhandsontable 0.2.2
-------------------------

* Added support in shiny for default column values when new row added (#33)

* Fixed bug that jumbled columns when some column names were numeric (#47, #52)

* Fixed a bug in the validation logic that was preventing the call background from changing to red for invalid entries when allowInvalid = TRUE (#48)

rhandsontable 0.2.1
-------------------------

* Added a new function, hot_context_menu, to better control right-click menu. The option to export to csv has been removed for now, but a new context_menu example has been added that shows how to enable the option. The example also shows how to enable the table search functionality (#38, #41).

* Added a new comments parameter to rhandsontable to allow bulk comment specification.

* Added a new shiny _comment callback to track changes to table comments. See the new rhandsontable_comment example for more details.

* Added dateFormat to hot_col and allow passing additional column parameters. Future updates should hopefully allow more control over date formatting.

* Fixed a table resize bug (#26)

* Fixed hot_to_r to preserve original data classes when useTypes = FALSE (#39). See the rhandsontable_output example for more details.

* Fixed shiny select callback to use 1-based indices (instead of JavaScripts 0-based indices).

rhandsontable 0.2
-------------------------

* Added a project page at http://jrowen.github.io/rhandsontable

* Upgraded to handsontable 0.16.1

* Improved mapping between R classes and handsontable column types.  Numeric columns
  in R are now mapped to numeric columns in the table, and factors are now
  mapped as dropdown columns (#30).

* Numeric columns are now formatted as '0' for integers and '0.00' for all other
  numeric columns.  See http://http://numeraljs.com/ for more details on
  formatting options.

* Sparkline charts (http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/) can now be added to the
  table.  See the project page for examples, and thanks to the sparkline package and
  Ramnath Vaidyanathan for inspiration.  The sparkline chart width will be
  set to fit within the specified column width.  The feature is still evolving, so
  please pass along feedback.

* Display NA values as blank cells in the table.  This requires changing colums with NA
  values to character when displaying in handsontable and may require special handling
  for Date and factor columns.  See the examples on the project page for more details.
  Thanks to Melanie Bacou for the suggestion.

* Added stretchH parameter to hot_table.

* Fixed a bug where the table was not updated when resized.

* Fixed a bug with row indices when sorting rows (#34)

* Set overflow: auto and specified a default height = 400 in shiny (#21).

rhandsontable 0.1
-------------------------
